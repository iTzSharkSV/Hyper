# Contributing to this project

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Hyper!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Questions & Feedback

Have a question? The active community will be eager to assist you. Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

Your comments and feedback are welcome, and the development team is available via a handful of different channels.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in the project? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Identify where to Report

Can you recreate the issue even after disabling all your personal extensions? If you find the issue is caused by an extension you have installed, please file an issue on the extension's repo directly.

### Look for an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/iTzSharkSV/Hyper/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the most popular feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction. Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

-   üëç - upvote
-   üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

-   Version of Product

-   Your operating system

-   List of extensions/packages that you have installed

-   Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

-   What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

-   Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring

-   A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository the developers can easily pull down to recreate the issue locally

### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

-   [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue

-   [ ] Recreate the issue after disabling all extensions

-   [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!

### Follow Your Issue

Once submitted, your report will go into the issue tracking workflow. Be sure to understand what will happen next, so you know what to expect, and how to continue to assist throughout the process.
